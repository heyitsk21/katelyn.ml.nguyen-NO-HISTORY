                    <h1>Philanthropy</h1>
                    <p>
                        Ever since high school, I have been a part of many philanthropic fundraisers and have since grown to be able to lead the efforts. In high school specifically, I had a more direct connection to fundraising and philanthropy initiatives. I served on the finance committee for the National Honor Society, where I contributed to raising funds for 
                        <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.charitywater.org/">charity: water</a> through several events such as selling baked goods and hosting a male talent show where all proceeds from the show, including ticket sales, concessions, and merchandise, were donated, resulting in a total of $1,400 raised for that one event alone. As the president of the math honor society, Mu Alpha Theta, I founded, organized, and led a school-wide math tutoring program to promote peer-to-peer extended learning and deeper student-to-faculty relationships. When I came to college, I was on the Marketing and Finance committee for my Freshman Leadership Organization called <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.tamufest.org/">FEST</a> (here, I worked on social media posts, merchandise design, and profit share organizing) as well as on the Finance Committee for an organization called Engineers Serving the Community (where we sought varying ways to raise money for our org, including through outreach, profit shares, merchandise selling, and by reaching out for donations and grants from companies and other organizations. As a FLO, we also had a huge focus on volunteering so I got the pleasure of helping at Brazos Valley Food Bank often, as well as participating in events such as Shack-a-thon). I have also been a member and leader of the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.tamuvsa.org/">Vietnamese Student Association</a>. During my sophomore year of college, I sold merchandise and hosted a month-long "Officer Dares" initiative where individuals could donate money in exchange for seeing the officer team perform silly dares. The money raised throughout this entire year was sent to the 
                        <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://onebodyvillage.org/#about-us">One Body Village</a> organization. Finally, I am a part of Eta Kappa Nu (HKN) IEEE TAMU chapter, an honor society for Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering majors, where I participate in service events at locations in Bryan such as resale stores and donation warehouses, and here on campus as well. Through these experiences, I have developed a strong commitment to serving my community as well as learned varying ways of how to network and communicate to people beyond my typical sphere.
