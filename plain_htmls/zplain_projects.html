                    <h1>Licensing Manager</h1>
                    <p>
                        At my 2023 summer internship, I worked for an oil and gas directional drilling service company, MS Directional. There, one of my tasks was to create licenses and a licensing manager to streamline user efficiency of the company's testing software. This project required me to learn how to employ a cloud-based SQL database and encryption for the individual license files. This system utilized each machine's Windows Registry and was coded with C#. The user interface was created using XAML, WPF,  and MySQL queries.  Additionally, I used Git to connect my program to the legacy code and to track and save my progress. I learned these coding languages and components entirely on my own and completed the entire project within two weeks. I am extremely proud of this endeavor and I believe this is evidence that I am thoroughly capable of learning brand new things on my own in a short amount of time.

                        were designed and created by me with some help from my Junior Marketing Intern and Media Team. 
                        Photos were taken and edited in collaboration with my Public Relations Media Chair partner and my Media Team.
                        I also designed the current VSA logo and the merchandise sold during my leadership term.
