                        My name is Katelyn Nguyen. 
                        I am a proud member of the fighting <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tamu.edu/index.html">Texas Aggie</a> class of 2025! 
                        I am a computer engineering major pursuing minors in mathematics and cybersecurity.
                        Outside the classroom, I am involved in several organizations, including HKN-IEEE honor society, Vietnamese Student Association, Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers, and Aggie Women in Computer Science.
                        I also love spending my free time dancing, playing Minecraft, and solving nonogram puzzles.

                    <p>
                        I decided to pursue a 
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://catalog.tamu.edu/undergraduate/engineering/electrical-computer/computer-engineering-bs/#programrequirementstext"> Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering </a>
                        because of the fascination with the inner workings of electronic devices my dad helped foster within me. As a kid, I got to spend some of my dad’s extra vacation days messing around with junk from all over the house. I loved dismantling old toys and electronics to hands-on experience with their components and learning how they functioned. I was especially intrigued by the complexity and abstractness between hardware and code that powered these devices and I hope to continue to deepen my understanding by pursuing this field.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before my junior year of high school, I had no idea there was a major that combined both the hardware and software aspects of technology I had grown fond of. Once I learned that CPEN perfectly aligned with my interests, I’ve been very passionate about this degree. This major allows me to merge my aptitude for technology with my desire to create and innovate. One day, I hope to work with a tech company and play a role in the creation and testing of devices like laptops to contribute to the constantly evolving field. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I love how this program serves to create a foundation of knowledge to help me become better prepared for the increasingly advancing technological world. I can more deeply understand coding and how it truly works while also physically getting my hands on a complex system of wires and components. This major truly envelops my passions into the perfect package for me. 
                        It isn’t always sunshine and rainbows, though! There have been challenges in my program, especially when the concepts are complex and hard to visualize. However, it is always incredibly rewarding when the concepts finally click after weeks and weeks of studying and tutorials.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I believe my degree in Computer Engineering aligns perfectly with my career aspirations. I aim to work at the intersection of software and hardware development, contributing to innovative technological solutions. This program equips me with the knowledge and skills required to excel in the rapidly evolving tech industry. As I progress in my studies, I am confident that I am building a strong foundation to pursue a fulfilling career where I can continue to explore my passion for electronics and computing.

                    <h1>My Career Goals</h1>
                    <p>
                        With technology growing rapidly, I aspire to utilize my education and skills to become a key component in the industry.
                        In the immediate future, my objective is to secure summer internships that will afford me genuine, hands-on technical experience. This is not solely about acquiring skills, but also an opportunity for self-discovery. I hope to truly identify my strengths, discern optimal work environments, and immerse myself in diverse cultures and cityscapes. 
                        Looking ahead, my overarching goal is to achieve success in any reputable company. I aspire to be proud of the work I do and find joy in contributing to meaningful and impactful projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For this upcoming summer specificially, my goal is to obtain a full-time internship in areas relating to either software or hardware.
